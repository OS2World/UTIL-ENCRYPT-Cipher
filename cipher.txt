   CIPHER is fairly simple to use yet provides excellent file security.
It enrypts a file, making it unreadable junk until you decipher
the file using the correct key. CIPHER requires three parameters...
the cipher key, the input file and the output file. The key can be
any series of characters or numbers while the input file must be
a valid file name. (The output file will be created and so it doesn't
to be an valid existing file name.)

        As a simple demonstration, decipher the CIPHER.CPH file to
 a file name TEST.TXT. Type this command....
                "CIPHER 1234A CIPHER.CPH TEST.TXT"
        This will produce a valid ASCII text file named TEST.TXT.

        Enjoy!


        CIPHER was written by David Stafford and originally appeared
        in the July 1993 issue of Computer Shopper. It was changed
        slightly and compiled for OS/2 using Borland C++ for OS/2
        by David Eagen on July 11, 1993.
